        <h1 id="17makingcomplexdecisions">17. Making Complex Decisions</h1>

<p><strong>17.1</strong> [mdp-model-exercise]For the $4\times 3$ world shown in
Figure <a href="#/">sequential-decision-world-figure</a>, calculate
which squares can be reached from (1,1) by the action sequence
$[{Up},{Up},{Right},{Right},{Right}]$ and with what
probabilities. Explain how this computation is related to the prediction
task (see Section <a href="#/">general-filtering-section</a>) for a
hidden Markov model.</p>

<p><strong>17.2</strong> [mdp-model-exercise]For the $4\times 3$ world shown in
Figure <a href="#/">sequential-decision-world-figure</a>, calculate
which squares can be reached from (1,1) by the action sequence
$[{Right},{Right},{Right},{Up},{Up}]$ and with what
probabilities. Explain how this computation is related to the prediction
task (see Section <a href="#/">general-filtering-section</a>) for a
hidden Markov model.</p>

<p><strong>17.3</strong> Select a specific member of the set of policies that are optimal for
$R(s)>0$ as shown in
Figure <a href="#/">sequential-decision-policies-figure</a>(b), and
calculate the fraction of time the agent spends in each state, in the
limit, if the policy is executed forever. (<em>Hint</em>:
Construct the state-to-state transition probability matrix corresponding
to the policy and see
Exercise <a href="#/">markov-convergence-exercise</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>17.4</strong> [nonseparable-exercise]Suppose that we define the utility of a state
sequence to be the <em>maximum</em> reward obtained in any state
in the sequence. Show that this utility function does not result in
stationary preferences between state sequences. Is it still possible to
define a utility function on states such that MEU decision making gives
optimal behavior?</p>

<p><strong>17.5</strong> Can any finite search problem be translated exactly into a Markov
decision problem such that an optimal solution of the latter is also an
optimal solution of the former? If so, explain <em>precisely</em>
how to translate the problem and how to translate the solution back; if
not, explain <em>precisely</em> why not (i.e., give a
counterexample).</p>

<p><strong>17.6</strong> [reward-equivalence-exercise] Sometimes MDPs are formulated with a
reward function $R(s,a)$ that depends on the action taken or with a
reward function $R(s,a,s')$ that also depends on the outcome state.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Write the Bellman equations for these formulations.</p></li>

<li><p>Show how an MDP with reward function $R(s,a,s')$ can be transformed
into a different MDP with reward function $R(s,a)$, such that
optimal policies in the new MDP correspond exactly to optimal
policies in the original MDP.</p></li>

<li><p>Now do the same to convert MDPs with $R(s,a)$ into MDPs with $R(s)$.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>17.7</strong> [threshold-cost-exercise]For the environment shown in
Figure <a href="#/">sequential-decision-world-figure</a>, find all the
threshold values for $R(s)$ such that the optimal policy changes when
the threshold is crossed. You will need a way to calculate the optimal
policy and its value for fixed $R(s)$. (<em>Hint</em>: Prove that
the value of any fixed policy varies linearly with $R(s)$.)</p>

<p><strong>17.8</strong> [vi-contraction-exercise]
Equation (<a href="#/">vi-contraction-equation</a>) on
page <a href="#/">vi-contraction-equation</a> states that the Bellman operator is a contraction.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Show that, for any functions $f$ and $g$,
$$|\max<em>a f(a) - \max</em>a g(a)| \leq \max_a |f(a) - g(a)|\ .$$</p></li>

<li><p>Write out an expression for $|(B,U<em>i - B,U'</em>i)(s)|$ and then apply
the result from (a) to complete the proof that the Bellman operator
is a contraction.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>17.9</strong> This exercise considers two-player MDPs that correspond to zero-sum,
turn-taking games like those in
Chapter <a href="#/">game-playing-chapter</a>. Let the players be $A$
and $B$, and let $R(s)$ be the reward for player $A$ in state $s$. (The
reward for $B$ is always equal and opposite.)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Let $U<em>A(s)$ be the utility of state $s$ when it is $A$’s turn to
move in $s$, and let $U</em>B(s)$ be the utility of state $s$ when it is
$B$’s turn to move in $s$. All rewards and utilities are calculated
from $A$’s point of view (just as in a minimax game tree). Write
down Bellman equations defining $U<em>A(s)$ and $U</em>B(s)$.</p></li>

<li><p>Explain how to do two-player value iteration with these equations,
and define a suitable termination criterion.</p></li>

<li><p>Consider the game described in
Figure <a href="#/">line-game4-figure</a> on page <a href="#/">line-game4-figure</a>.
Draw the state space (rather than the game tree), showing the moves
by $A$ as solid lines and moves by $B$ as dashed lines. Mark each
state with $R(s)$. You will find it helpful to arrange the states
$(s<em>A,s</em>B)$ on a two-dimensional grid, using $s<em>A$ and $s</em>B$ as
“coordinates.”</p></li>

<li><p>Now apply two-player value iteration to solve this game, and derive
the optimal policy.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>17.10</strong> [3x3-mdp-exercise] Consider the $3 \times 3$ world shown in
Figure <a href="#grid-mdp-figure">grid-mdp-figure</a>(a). The transition model is the
same as in the $4\times 3$
Figure <a href="#/">sequential-decision-world-figure</a>: 80% of the
time the agent goes in the direction it selects; the rest of the time it
moves at right angles to the intended direction.</p>

<p>Implement value iteration for this world for each value of $r$ below.
Use discounted rewards with a discount factor of 0.99. Show the policy
obtained in each case. Explain intuitively why the value of $r$ leads to
each policy.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>$r = -100$</p></li>

<li><p>$r = -3$</p></li>

<li><p>$r = 0$</p></li>

<li><p>$r = +3$</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>17.11</strong> [101x3-mdp-exercise] Consider the $101 \times 3$ world shown in
Figure <a href="#grid-mdp-figure">grid-mdp-figure</a>(b). In the start state the agent
has a choice of two deterministic actions, <em>Up</em> or
<em>Down</em>, but in the other states the agent has one
deterministic action, <em>Right</em>. Assuming a discounted reward
function, for what values of the discount $\gamma$ should the agent
choose <em>Up</em> and for which <em>Down</em>? Compute the
utility of each action as a function of $\gamma$. (Note that this simple
example actually reflects many real-world situations in which one must
weigh the value of an immediate action versus the potential continual
long-term consequences, such as choosing to dump pollutants into a
lake.)</p>

<p><strong>17.12</strong> Consider an undiscounted MDP having three states, (1, 2, 3), with
rewards $-1$, $-2$, $0$, respectively. State 3 is a terminal state. In
states 1 and 2 there are two possible actions: $a$ and $b$. The
transition model is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In state 1, action $a$ moves the agent to state 2 with probability
0.8 and makes the agent stay put with probability 0.2.</p></li>

<li><p>In state 2, action $a$ moves the agent to state 1 with probability
0.8 and makes the agent stay put with probability 0.2.</p></li>

<li><p>In either state 1 or state 2, action $b$ moves the agent to state 3
with probability 0.1 and makes the agent stay put with
probability 0.9.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Answer the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What can be determined <em>qualitatively</em> about the
optimal policy in states 1 and 2?</p></li>

<li><p>Apply policy iteration, showing each step in full, to determine the
optimal policy and the values of states 1 and 2. Assume that the
initial policy has action $b$ in both states.</p></li>

<li><p>What happens to policy iteration if the initial policy has action
$a$ in both states? Does discounting help? Does the optimal policy
depend on the discount factor?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>17.13</strong> Consider the $4\times 3$ world shown in
Figure <a href="#/">sequential-decision-world-figure</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Implement an environment simulator for this environment, such that
the specific geography of the environment is easily altered. Some
code for doing this is already in the online code repository.</p></li>

<li><p>Create an agent that uses policy iteration, and measure its
performance in the environment simulator from various
starting states. Perform several experiments from each starting
state, and compare the average total reward received per run with
the utility of the state, as determined by your algorithm.</p></li>

<li><p>Experiment with increasing the size of the environment. How does the
run time for policy iteration vary with the size of the environment?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>17.14</strong> [policy-loss-exercise]How can the value determination algorithm be
used to calculate the expected loss experienced by an agent using a
given set of utility estimates ${U}$ and an estimated
model ${P}$, compared with an agent using correct values?</p>

<p><strong>17.15</strong> [4x3-pomdp-exercise] Let the initial belief state $b<em>0$ for the
$4\times 3$ POMDP on page <a href="#/">4x3-pomdp-page</a> be the uniform distribution
over the nonterminal states, i.e.,
$&lt; \frac{1}{9},\frac{1}{9},\frac{1}{9},\frac{1}{9},\frac{1}{9},\frac{1}{9},\frac{1}{9},\frac{1}{9},\frac{1}{9},0,0 >$.
Calculate the exact belief state $b</em>1$ after the agent moves and its
sensor reports 1 adjacent wall. Also calculate $b_2$ assuming that the
same thing happens again.</p>

<p><strong>17.16</strong> What is the time complexity of $d$ steps of POMDP value iteration for a
sensorless environment?</p>

<p><strong>17.17</strong> [2state-pomdp-exercise] Consider a version of the two-state POMDP on
page <a href="#/">2state-pomdp-page</a> in which the sensor is 90% reliable in state 0 but
provides no information in state 1 (that is, it reports 0 or 1 with
equal probability). Analyze, either qualitatively or quantitatively, the
utility function and the optimal policy for this problem.</p>

<p><strong>17.18</strong> [dominant-equilibrium-exercise]Show that a dominant strategy
equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium, but not vice versa.</p>

<p><strong>17.19</strong> In the children’s game of rock–paper–scissors each player reveals at the
same time a choice of rock, paper, or scissors. Paper wraps rock, rock
blunts scissors, and scissors cut paper. In the extended version
rock–paper–scissors–fire–water, fire beats rock, paper, and scissors;
rock, paper, and scissors beat water; and water beats fire. Write out
the payoff matrix and find a mixed-strategy solution to this game.</p>

<p><strong>17.20</strong> Solve the game of <em>three</em>-finger Morra.</p>

<p><strong>17.21</strong> In the <em>Prisoner’s Dilemma</em>, consider the case where after
each round, Alice and Bob have probability $X$ meeting again. Suppose
both players choose the perpetual punishment strategy (where each will
choose ${refuse}$ unless the other player has ever played
${testify}$). Assume neither player has played ${testify}$ thus far.
What is the expected future total payoff for choosing to ${testify}$
versus ${refuse}$ when $X = .2$? How about when $X = .05$? For what
value of $X$ is the expected future total payoff the same whether one
chooses to ${testify}$ or ${refuse}$ in the current round?</p>

<p><strong>17.22</strong> The following payoff matrix, from @Blinder:1983 by way of @Bernstein:1996, shows a game between
politicians and the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>|     | Fed: contract | Fed: do nothing  | Fed: expand     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <strong>Pol: contract</strong>    | $F=7, P=1$ | $F=9,P=4$  | $F=6,P=6$   |
| <strong>Pol: do nothing</strong>  | $F=8, P=2$ | $F=5,P=5$  | $F=4,P=9$   |
| <strong>Pol: expand</strong>      | $F=3, P=3$ | $F=2,P=7$  | $F=1,P=8$   |</p>

<p>Politicians can expand or contract fiscal policy, while the Fed can
expand or contract monetary policy. (And of course either side can
choose to do nothing.) Each side also has preferences for who should do
what—neither side wants to look like the bad guys. The payoffs shown are
simply the rank orderings: 9 for first choice through 1 for last choice.
Find the Nash equilibrium of the game in pure strategies. Is this a
Pareto-optimal solution? You might wish to analyze the policies of
recent administrations in this light.</p>

<p><strong>17.23</strong> A Dutch auction is similar in an English auction, but rather than
starting the bidding at a low price and increasing, in a Dutch auction
the seller starts at a high price and gradually lowers the price until
some buyer is willing to accept that price. (If multiple bidders accept
the price, one is arbitrarily chosen as the winner.) More formally, the
seller begins with a price $p$ and gradually lowers $p$ by increments of
$d$ until at least one buyer accepts the price. Assuming all bidders act
rationally, is it true that for arbitrarily small $d$, a Dutch auction
will always result in the bidder with the highest value for the item
obtaining the item? If so, show mathematically why. If not, explain how
it may be possible for the bidder with highest value for the item not to
obtain it.</p>

<p><strong>17.24</strong> Imagine an auction mechanism that is just like an ascending-bid auction,
except that at the end, the winning bidder, the one who bid $b<em>{max}$,
pays only $b</em>{max}/2$ rather than $b_{max}$. Assuming all agents are
rational, what is the expected revenue to the auctioneer for this
mechanism, compared with a standard ascending-bid auction?</p>

<p><strong>17.25</strong> Teams in the National Hockey League historically received 2 points for
winning a game and 0 for losing. If the game is tied, an overtime period
is played; if nobody wins in overtime, the game is a tie and each team
gets 1 point. But league officials felt that teams were playing too
conservatively in overtime (to avoid a loss), and it would be more
exciting if overtime produced a winner. So in 1999 the officials
experimented in mechanism design: the rules were changed, giving a team
that loses in overtime 1 point, not 0. It is still 2 points for a win
and 1 for a tie.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Was hockey a zero-sum game before the rule change? After?</p></li>

<li><p>Suppose that at a certain time $t$ in a game, the home team has
probability $p$ of winning in regulation time, probability $0.78-p$
of losing, and probability 0.22 of going into overtime, where they
have probability $q$ of winning, $.9-q$ of losing, and .1 of tying.
Give equations for the expected value for the home and
visiting teams.</p></li>

<li><p>Imagine that it were legal and ethical for the two teams to enter
into a pact where they agree that they will skate to a tie in
regulation time, and then both try in earnest to win in overtime.
Under what conditions, in terms of $p$ and $q$, would it be rational
for both teams to agree to this pact?</p></li>

<li><p>@Longley+Sankaran:2005 report that since the rule change, the percentage of games with a
winner in overtime went up 18.2%, as desired, but the percentage of
overtime games also went up 3.6%. What does that suggest about
possible collusion or conservative play after the rule change?</p></li>
