# This is the old Aima Exercise page which I started building first , then after suggestion of my Mentor Peter I changed to the new website linked below .

This was the 1st website design that I made for AIMA-EXERCISE . I wrote a lot of CSS clippings for this .


The website is live at : https://kaustabhganguly.github.io/aima-website-1




# Note :

- This website is for showcasing design sense only .
- Incomplete jekyll portion of the website which I was building to show that I am comfortable with any framework and can learn anything if needed . But I stopped midway to shift my attention to make the new website .New jekyll website in other repository .
- **Complete website with mathjax integration can be found at https://kaustabhganguly.github.io/aima-exercise-2**
