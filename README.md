# AIMA EXERCISE GITHUB PAGE 

This was the 1st website design that I made for AIMA-EXERCISE . I wrote a lot of CSS clippings for this .

Then I changed the website to a more whitish and minimalistic paper like website , which is currently live at https://kaustabhganguly.github.io and source code at https://www.github.com/kaustabhganguly/kaustabhganguly.github.io


This website :
# Website is live [here](https://kaustabhganguly.github.io/Cool-website-aima/)


# Note :

- Many Exercises are not properly formatted as I changed the design midway .
- Not well mobile support
- Incomplete jekyll portion of the website which I was building to show that I am comfortable with any framework and can learn anything if needed . But I stopped midway to shift my attention to make the new website .
