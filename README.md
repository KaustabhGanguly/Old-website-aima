# AIMA EXERCISE GITHUB PAGE 

- Intro Exercise
- Advanced Search exercise
- Advanced Planning Exercise

The above three are online . The rest exercises are on the way .

In the kaustabhganguly.github.io/exercises.html page âœ“ sign indicates the exercises that are online .

## Advanced Search Exercise is full solved with solutions , except a few questions . Other Exercises will be like this .

I added Hover effect for the answers so the answer doesn't show directly and making it as a hover effect makes the website very fast rather than making a button .

Advanced Planning Exercise is very errorish and I will correct it later after I make all exercise Online .

I made a lot of changes to the design and style and it loads a lot faster now .
